# hXl3s C++ magiclib toolkit

This library is a set of data structures and algorithms that I found useful to have. It is used as my own C++ framework for programming. Most of stuffs here are hand-written, but I also offer wrappers for third-party library. Yes, I know there are probably better implementations, that I can use, but writting you own is fun, isn't it? Nethertheless, mayby someone will find it usefull

## Requirements (third parties, that I already wrapped or I will wrap in future)

- (C++) Boost 1.67.0
- (C++) Eigen 3.3.5
- (C++) Intel MKL
- (C++) Intel MKL-DNN
- (C++) Intel IPP
- (C++) Intel TBB
- (C++) gtest 1.8.0
